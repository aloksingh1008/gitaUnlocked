# Routing Structure

This document explains the routing structure implemented for the Gita Unlocked application.

## Routes

### Main Routes
- `/` - Home page (index.vue)
- `/courses` - Course information page (courses.vue)
- `/register` - Registration page (register.vue)
- `/about` - About us page (about.vue)
- `/contact` - Contact/Connect with us page (contact.vue)

### Dynamic Routes
- `/solutions/[solution]` - Dynamic solution pages (solutions/[solution].vue)
  - Examples: `/solutions/Depression`, `/solutions/Stress`, `/solutions/Anger`
  - Supports all solution types: Depression, Relationships, Sleep, Stress, Addiction, Overthinking, Loneliness, Anger, Greed, Laziness

## Navigation

The navigation is handled by the `NavLinks.vue` component which now uses:
- `NuxtLink` components for proper routing
- `navigateTo()` function for programmatic navigation
- Preserved dropdown functionality for "Find Solution For" section

## Key Changes

1. **Created pages directory** with individual page files
2. **Updated NavLinks component** to use Nuxt routing instead of state management
3. **Simplified app.vue** to use `<NuxtPage />` for content rendering
4. **Preserved existing logic** for dynamic component loading in solution pages
5. **Maintained responsive design** and mobile menu functionality

## Benefits

- ✅ Proper URL routing for all pages
- ✅ Browser back/forward button support
