      Addiction: A Battle for Our Consciousness
    </h2>
    <p class="italic">Chapter 03 & 07 | Illustrated with metaphors | Gita Unlocked Series</p>
    <p>
      Addiction is not just a habit. It’s an abduction, a hijack, a spiritual war—a multi-layered attack on our very consciousness. Though it often begins subtly, with innocent indulgence, it ends up chaining us, draining us, and leaving us stranded in a prison of compulsions. The Bhagavad-gita exposes this enemy from multiple dimensions and gives us the wisdom and tools to fight back—not just for relief, but for complete release.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 1 -->
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#C700C1] mt-6">Addiction is an Abductor Who Never Releases</h3>
    <div class="bg-[#FFF3E0] p-5 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-orange-500 shadow">
      <p>
        Imagine a child abducted by a criminal who demands ransom—but after receiving the ransom, refuses to release the child. Instead, the demands increase. Again. And again. This is exactly what addiction does. It demands indulgence after indulgence, promising freedom with each payment, but never delivering. Even after we indulge, the urge returns—stronger, louder, and more relentless. We end up paying with our peace, our time, our relationships, our health. And still, we remain captive.

    <!-- Section 2 -->
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#C700C1] mt-6">Addiction is Like Joining an Underworld Gang</h3>
    <div class="bg-[#E3F2FD] p-5 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-blue-400 shadow">
      <p>
        Once someone joins a criminal gang, walking away isn’t so easy. The gang doesn't just let them go—especially if they’ve done a lot for it. The person becomes bound by threats, guilt, and fear. Similarly, when we indulge in sensual pleasure, we sign a subtle contract with illusion. It draws us in gently, but once we’re deep, the forces of illusion grip us tight. The more we serve those forces—by repeatedly indulging, encouraging others to indulge, or glamorizing indulgence—the tighter their hold becomes.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2 font-semibold text-purple-700">(Bhagavad-gita 7.14)</p>
      <p class="mt-2">Trying to quit later? The system retaliates, often violently. Cravings, loneliness, despair—all rise like underworld threats to pull us back in. This is not just habit—it is a spiritual enslavement.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#C700C1] mt-6">Addiction Hijacks Our Consciousness</h3>
    <div class="bg-[#FFF8E1] p-5 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-yellow-500 shadow">
      <p>
        As souls, our consciousness is a powerful stream of awareness and purpose. But addiction hijacks this stream and redirects it toward objects or thoughts we know are harmful. Even when not indulging, our mind spins around how to indulge next. It feels like freedom, but we are bound. Our body moves, but our mind is in chains.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">Like a virus running in the background, addiction consumes energy silently. We look normal, but inside, our processor is overheating.</p>
      <p class="mt-2 font-semibold text-purple-700">(Bhagavad-gita 3.36)</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 4 -->
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#C700C1] mt-6">Addiction Is Like an Itch That Scratching Makes Worse</h3>
    <div class="bg-[#E8F5E9] p-5 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-green-500 shadow">
      <p>
        Itching brings discomfort, and scratching brings relief—but also wounds. Addiction works the same way. The urge torments us; indulgence gives short-term relief. But afterward? Guilt, pain, dependency. Yet, the next time the urge arises, our memory serves us only the relief, not the wound. And so we scratch again.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2 font-semibold text-purple-700">(Bhagavad-gita 3.39)</p>
      <p class="mt-2">To stop, we need determination—which is born from remembrance. Remembrance of the pain that follows indulgence. That’s when inner strength awakens.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 5 -->
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#C700C1] mt-6">Addiction Is Fueling a Fire That Can Never Be Doused</h3>
    <div class="bg-[#F3E5F5] p-5 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-purple-400 shadow">
      <p>
        Our longing for happiness is spiritual—it craves the infinite. But material pleasures are finite. So trying to satisfy the infinite with the finite is like pouring ghee into fire to put it out—it only blazes higher. The world dangles one object after another, promising joy. But once we chase and taste them, we’re still dry… still thirsty… still chasing.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">This misdirection leads to madness. That’s why Bhagavad-gita calls lust “an eternal enemy”—because it keeps rising, stronger every time it’s fed.</p>
      <p class="mt-2 font-semibold text-purple-700">(Bhagavad-gita 3.39)</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 6 -->
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#C700C1] mt-6">So… Can We Ever Break Free?</h3>
    <div class="bg-[#FFFDE7] p-5 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-yellow-600 shadow">
      <p>
        Yes. But not by negotiation. Addiction won’t listen to “just one last time.” Like a gang member seeking escape, like a hostage needing rescue—we need protection. Divine protection. Krishna says clearly in Gita 7.14:
      </p>
      <blockquote class="italic mt-2 text-purple-700">“This material energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes, is very difficult to overcome. But those who surrender unto Me can easily cross beyond it.”</blockquote>
      <p class="mt-2">We need to take shelter—real, conscious, determined shelter—in something higher. Not just abstaining, but replacing. Not just resisting, but reconnecting—with the Infinite.</p>
      <p class="mt-2">That is where bhakti comes in. Bhakti doesn’t just tell us to stop indulging; it gives us a taste of something far better—something that satisfies, purifies, and liberates. Through prayer, mantra, service, association, and surrender, we get real strength—not just to fight the urge, but to rise above it entirely.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 7 -->
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#C700C1] mt-6">Think It Over</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 bg-[#E3F2FD] p-5 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-blue-400 shadow">
      <li>Has indulgence ever made you feel free initially but more bound afterward?</li>
      <li>Which metaphor—abductor, gang, itch, or fire—most describes your own struggle?</li>
      <li>What first small step can you take today to stop scratching the itch and start seeking shelter?</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Section 8 -->
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#C700C1] mt-6">Don’t Just Cut the Branch—Uproot the Root</h3>
    <div class="bg-[#E8F5E9] p-5 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-green-500 shadow">
      <p>
        The cravings we face are just the branches. Even if we cut them, the roots—deep beliefs, attachments, misidentifications—remain underground and sprout again. That’s why just self-help won’t work long-term. Like a doctor gives temporary medicine but prescribes a full course for complete healing, we invite you to attend our course at Gita Unlocked.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">There, we go beyond surface fixes and discover how to:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mt-2">
        <li>Understand addiction through the lens of eternal truth</li>
        <li>Uproot illusion, not just suppress symptoms</li>
        <li>Experience deeper fulfillment that ends the craving cycle</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-2 font-semibold text-green-700">👉 Come explore the open secret of lasting inner strength. Freedom isn’t far—it begins with the first conscious step.</p>
