      Stress – Finding the Eye of the Storm
    </h2>
    <p>
      In today’s fast-paced world, stress is no longer a rare guest—it’s become a constant companion. Whether you're a student juggling deadlines, a professional navigating endless emails, or someone simply trying to keep up with life, the invisible pressure often weighs heavily. But what if stress isn’t just about doing too much—but thinking too much?
    </p>

    <!-- Section 1 -->
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#C700C1] mt-6">We’re Not Overworked—We’re Overworried</h3>
    <div class="bg-[#FFF3E0] p-5 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-orange-500 shadow">
      <p>
        Contrary to popular belief, stress doesn’t always come from excessive workload. Sometimes, even doing very little can feel overwhelming. Think of someone on vacation, scrolling endlessly, unable to relax despite no responsibilities. The real culprit isn’t the work—it’s the worry.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">We’re often engaged in one task but mentally juggling ten others. Our mind races: “What if I miss that deadline?”, “What if something goes wrong?”, “What if I fail?” This obsessive overthinking—trying to control what is not in our control—is the true breeding ground of stress.</p>
      <p class="mt-2">Why this obsession with control? Modern life has conditioned us to believe that we must handle everything. Technology has amplified our sense of control, and with diminishing awareness of any higher controller, we feel compelled to manage the uncontrollable. But the <strong class="text-purple-700">Bhagavad Gita (18.35)</strong> reminds us: ignorance of spiritual truth gives rise to fear and anxiety.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="font-semibold text-[#FF7A00] mt-3">👉 The solution? Rediscovering two powerful truths:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
      <li>We are indestructible souls—the worries that grip us can’t touch our true self.</li>
      <li>Krishna is the supreme controller—even when things spiral beyond our grasp, He can turn the worst situations into a higher good. Our role is to act sincerely, with faith, and let Him guide the outcome.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#C700C1] mt-6">Three Timeless Principles to Reclaim Inner Calm</h3>
    <div class="bg-[#E3F2FD] p-5 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-blue-400 shadow">
      <p>In this noisy world, how do we reclaim clarity and calm? The Gita gives a practical three-step compass: <strong>Simplify, Clarify, Purify</strong>.</p>
      <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 mt-3">
        <li><strong>Simplify</strong> – Stress thrives in complexity. Too many tasks, too many choices, too much digital noise. We can’t always change the world—but we can change how we interact with it. Regularizing routines like sleep, meals, and screen time gives the mind stability. Avoiding small, draining decisions frees up mental space. Digital detoxes or monitored usage can ease the mind into stillness.</li>
        <li><strong>Clarify</strong> – Not everything that demands attention deserves it. What truly matters to you? Take time to introspect. Journaling and reflective reading—especially from timeless texts like the Bhagavad Gita—reconnect you to your core priorities. When your compass points True North, confusion fades.</li>
        <li><strong>Purify</strong> – Even after knowing what’s important, we often drift due to inner clutter—unhealthy habits, desires, or distractions. Through spiritual practices like prayer, meditation, and especially bhakti-yoga, we cleanse the heart and strengthen our higher self. When the inner noise fades, stress loses its grip.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#C700C1] mt-6">Balance Is the Real Success Formula</h3>
    <div class="bg-[#FFF8E1] p-5 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-yellow-500 shadow">
      <p>
        Managing stress isn’t about escape—it’s about balance. Just like riding a bicycle requires staying centred, life requires balancing all its aspects. When you ignore any one side—health, family, rest, work, or spirituality—you feel the pinch. That pinch is a signal: return to the centre.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">Balance your energy between work and rejuvenation. Even short meditative breaks or shared meals can recharge your mind. Engage not just your logical brain but also your creative side—through music, art, poetry, or any form of expression that activates joy and intuition. When both sides of the mind are aligned, clarity and calm naturally arise.</p>
      <p class="mt-2">Also, serve. Help others. Even small acts of kindness dissolve internal tension and reconnect you with something larger than yourself.</p>
      <p class="mt-2 font-semibold text-yellow-600">👉 And perhaps most importantly—make peace with imperfection. Allow space for the dust, in others and in yourself. Not everything needs to be polished; even the dustbin has a rightful place in a clean home.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 4 -->
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#C700C1] mt-6">The Root Must Be Pulled Out</h3>
    <div class="bg-[#E8F5E9] p-5 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-green-500 shadow">
      <p>
        Stress is like a weed. You can trim the top, but if the root remains, it will grow back. Surface-level techniques help for a while—but to be truly free, you must go deeper.
