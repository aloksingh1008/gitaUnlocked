      Loneliness: When Hearts Drift Further Than Galaxies
    </h2>
    <p>
      In today’s world, loneliness is not just about being alone. Cities are densely packed, and people live just feet apart in towering apartments. Yet many feel emotionally distant — as if everyone around is walking on a separate planet. The real crisis is not the lack of company, but the lack of connection.
    </p>

    <div class="bg-[#FFF3E0] p-5 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-orange-500 shadow">
      <p>
        Loneliness is often born from this: <br />
        <strong>The non-intersection of emotional worlds.</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Each person carries within them their own emotional world — shaped by personal desires, priorities, struggles, and hopes. When two people’s emotional worlds don’t overlap, they may live together, speak often, even smile — but deep inside, they feel unseen and unheard.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Even sincere gestures of care often miss their mark because they’re expressed from within isolated perspectives. The result? Widespread emotional disconnection.
      </p>

    <!-- Section 2 -->
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#C700C1] mt-6">The Material Cocoon</h3>
    <div class="bg-[#E3F2FD] p-5 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-blue-400 shadow">
      <p>
        What causes this fragmentation? One key cause is materialism — an intense, often unconscious obsession with external goals, possessions, and appearances. This mindset narrows our inner vision. We begin to:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mt-2">
        <li>Measure others based on usefulness to our plans.</li>
        <li>Prioritize personal gain over mutual growth.</li>
        <li>Engage with people more as roles than as individuals.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Even when people want to care, their ability to connect is filtered through this self-centered lens. This creates a cocoon — an emotional bubble that separates each person from the rest.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">In this way, even crowded spaces can feel like deserts.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#C700C1] mt-6">The Gita’s Vision: A Deeper Connection</h3>
    <div class="bg-[#FFF8E1] p-5 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-yellow-500 shadow">
      <blockquote class="italic text-purple-700">
        “The wise see with equal vision a learned scholar, a cow, an elephant, a dog, and a dog-eater.”
      </blockquote>
      <p class="mt-2 font-semibold">– Bhagavad Gita 5.18</p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        This verse reveals something profound: underneath all our labels and appearances, we are essentially the same — conscious beings. When we understand this, we stop seeing others through the lens of competition or comparison, and start recognizing their shared essence.
      </p>
      <blockquote class="italic text-purple-700 mt-4">
        “I am seated in everyone’s heart…”
      </blockquote>
      <p class="mt-2 font-semibold">– Bhagavad Gita 15.15</p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        This means we are never truly alone. There is always a higher presence within — a quiet companion who understands us better than anyone else. When we become conscious of this presence, it anchors us from within. We no longer depend fully on external validation for inner fulfillment.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        This shift in identity — from body to self, from roles to soul — is what truly dissolves loneliness from its roots.
      </p>

        You may try many things to fight loneliness — socializing, hobbies, distractions. They help, like a doctor’s quick medicine might ease a headache. But without addressing the root cause, the problem comes back. Like a tree cut from the top but left rooted underground, it will regrow.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        That’s why we invite you to explore our Gita Unlocked Course. It’s not just information — it’s a deep diagnostic journey into your own inner world. Just like a good doctor not only gives temporary relief but also prescribes a long-term healing course, this program addresses loneliness at its very root — showing you who you truly are, and how to connect with others meaningfully.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Because loneliness is not just a social problem — it's a spiritual misunderstanding of self and life. The course opens your vision, heals your heart, and teaches you how to live in connection — with yourself, with others, and with the one who resides in everyone’s heart.
