    <h2 class="text-3xl font-extrabold text-[#FF7A00] uppercase">Relationships: A Guide to Love, Respect, and Stability</h2>
    <p>
      Relationships are one of the most beautiful yet challenging aspects of human life. Ironically, as society advances, relationships have become more fragile. What once came naturally now often requires counseling, self-help books, or endless discussions. Why? Why have relationships, which should be sources of joy, turned into sources of stress?
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#C700C1] mt-6">Why Are Relationships So Difficult?</h3>
    <div class="bg-[#FFF3E0] p-5 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-orange-500 shadow">
      <p>
        Many blame “incompatibility,” but the real issue is often <strong class="text-orange-700">inflexibility</strong>. No two people are perfectly compatible—even soulmates differ. When we refuse to adjust, empathize, or understand, rigidity chokes love. In <strong class="text-purple-700">Bhagavad Gita (13.10)</strong>, Krishna describes detachment, even-mindedness, and freedom from possessiveness as true wisdom—qualities that bring stability in relationships.
      </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#C700C1] mt-6">Love Needs Wisdom</h3>
    <div class="bg-[#F3F4F6] p-5 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-purple-500 shadow">
      <p>
        Negative emotions like jealousy, greed, anger, and possessiveness are distortions of love. <strong class="text-purple-700">Love without wisdom</strong> becomes dependence—demanding too much, giving too little, and blaming others for our state of mind. But when love matures with wisdom, it knows balance, acceptance, and clarity.

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#C700C1] mt-6">The Danger of Unhealthy Attachment</h3>
    <div class="bg-[#E3F2FD] p-5 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-blue-400 shadow">
      <p>
        Desperate attachment suffocates love. It forces us to compromise values for approval. Like Dhritarashtra’s blind attachment to Duryodhana, unhealthy bonds cloud truth and purpose. <strong class="text-blue-700">Healthy love allows freedom, unhealthy love traps.</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2 font-semibold text-blue-600">👉 Lesson: Attachment without wisdom is fear disguised as love.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#C700C1] mt-6">Know When to Defer, When to Differ</h3>
    <div class="bg-[#FFF3E0] p-5 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-orange-500 shadow">
      <p>
        Conflicts are natural. The question is: should we yield or hold ground? The Gita offers balance. After Abhimanyu’s death, sometimes Krishna deferred to Arjuna, other times Arjuna deferred to Krishna. Real intelligence, says <strong class="text-purple-700">Gita (18.30)</strong>, lies in knowing what should and should not be done.
      </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#C700C1] mt-6">Shared Values Make Relationships Steady</h3>
    <div class="bg-[#F3F4F6] p-5 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-purple-500 shadow">
      <p>
        External attractions fade—looks, wealth, status. What sustains is <strong class="text-purple-700">shared values</strong>. Especially spiritual values, which outlast temporary bonds. As <strong class="text-blue-700">Gita (10.09)</strong> teaches, those who unite spiritually experience joy not only in each other but in shared devotion and purpose.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2 font-semibold text-purple-600">👉 Lesson: Build on values, not vanity.</p>

    <div class="bg-[#E3F2FD] p-5 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-blue-400 shadow">
      <p>
        Changing partners without inner growth repeats the same patterns. True strength comes from self-awareness. When you learn to relate to yourself, you can relate to others with stability and depth.

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 bg-[#FFF3E0] p-5 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-orange-500 shadow">
      <li><strong>Stop Trying to Impress:</strong> Naturalness builds trust. Pretending builds pressure.</li>
      <li><strong>Respect Needs Depth:</strong> True respect comes from inner strength.</li>
      <li><strong>Love Without Demanding:</strong> Give without expectation. Let love contribute, not transact.</li>
      <li><strong>Let Fights Be Constructive:</strong> A bigger shared goal reduces ego clashes.</li>
      <li><strong>Value Humour and Space:</strong> Laughter heals. Space strengthens love.</li>
      <li><strong>Stop Seeking Proof:</strong> Love lives in small acts, not constant validation.</li>
      <li><strong>Don’t Dwell in Emotional Garbage:</strong> Overthinking ruins what love builds.</li>
      <li><strong>Rise Above Jealousy:</strong> Celebrate others’ joys. Trust what is yours.</li>
      <li><strong>Protect Your Mind:</strong> Never trade peace for someone else’s ignorance.</li>

    <div class="bg-[#F3F4F6] p-5 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-purple-500 shadow">
      <p>
        Tips and techniques patch the surface. Real change requires addressing the root—our consciousness and identity. The Gita transforms not only how we view relationships but how we view life itself.
